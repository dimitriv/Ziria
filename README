Blink is a programming language and compiler for low-level bitstream processing. 

Some useful information:

* Blink top-level directory structure:

     src/    Haskell source code
   tools/    A few useful tools 
     lib/    Some simple Blink libraries
   _csrc/    C code and C libraries
  _tests/    Testsuite 
   _code/    WiFi implementation code
     doc/    Various documentation and design notes
_scripts/    Various scripts for building in different environments

* Building the compiler:

  Pre-requisites: recent version of GHC and Cabal. You will be 
  prompted for extra Haskell packages you may need to install.

  To build: go to src and type 'make'. You will be left with a 'wplc'
  binary. Install extra packages you may need with Cabal install.

* Running the tests:

  Pre-requisites: You must have gcc installed. If you have gcc
  installed go to _tests/_backend or _tests/_parser and type 'make'.

  To compile and run performance tests and the WiFi testsuite you must
  have SORA installed. More documentation can be found in doc/
