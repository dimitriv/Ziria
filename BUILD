To build the Ziria (wplc) compiler (under Linux or Windows/Cygwin) you will need:

* GHC 7.6 (including a cabal installation)
* The cabal packages (install them with 'cabal install <package-name>'
   - text-1.1.1.3
   - parsec
   - mainland-pretty
   - language-c-quote 
   - dlist
   - unix-compat

Then go to the Ziria root folder and type 'make'. You will be left with a 'wplc' binary.
