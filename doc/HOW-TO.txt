Q: How do I set up the basic build environment?
A: Install Cygwin from http://cygwin.com and add its bin directory
   (by default, C:\cygwin64\bin for a 64 bit install) to your PATH environment variable.
   This directory should be *prepended* to your $PATH. In particular,
   it *must* go before any other gcc, make, etc. binaries you may also have
   on your $PATH, or you will encounter strange problems trying to compile with WinDDK
   and possibly other things as well.
   You will also need a recent version of the Haskell Platform. Since the Platform ships
   with its own gcc binary, take care that Cygwin appears *before* the Platform on your
   $PATH.
   Finally, you will want to make sure that your Haskell Platform and Cygwin are both
   64 bit or 32 bit - no mixing! 64 bit Platform wants 64 bit Cygwin, and the same goes
   for 32 bits.

Q: How to compile the code?
A: For the simplest examples, just run wpl.exe. 
   Longer examples use g++ preprocessor. One can use preprocesscompile.sh bathc file (e.g. in wifi) as a shortcut.
   There are also runOne script files in many directories that will compile wpl, compile c with gcc and run the code in one line.
   Also, runTest will typically run the same thing for many files.

Q: How to evaluate performance?
A: Performance evaluation is done using WinDDK (driver development kit) environment used by SORA. 
   The reason is that gcc and VSS are several orders of magnitude slower in some cases. 
   The simplest way to compile and run a wpl file in this environment is using runOnePerf script (e.g. in wifi/receiver). 
   There is also runTestPerf that will run for multiple files (files are specified in sourcesPerf). 

Q: How to install WinDDK and Sora?
A: To install WinDDK, get an ISO from:
   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800
   It will be installed in C:\WinDDK. The version should be 7600.16385.1. 
   Next, install Sora v1.8 (it might work with newer versions but it is not tested).
   Make sure the environment variable SORA_ROOT (with capital letters) is set to the Sora root (e.g. SORA_ROOT="C:\SoraSDK1.8")
   Once Sora is installed, run "Windows Win7 x64 Free Build Environment" (a CMD-type icon in your start menu). 
     IMPORTANT: Do not try to compile Sora from regular cmd.exe shell or cygwin -- it will fail!
     		If you cannot find it in the start menu, look for it in:
		C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Windows Driver Kits\WDK 7600.16385.1\Build Environments\Windows 7
   Go to Sora directory, and then src directory (c:\SoraSDK1.8\src).
   Run "set_dirs_x64.cmd" (to set up the correct paths) and then run "bcz" (to make the libraries).
   Once this is done, you should see the following libraries:
   - In C:\SoraSDK1.8\lib\fre_win7_amd64\amd64 you should see usora.lib
   - In C:\SoraSDK1.8\target\fre_win7_amd64\amd64 you should see:
        dot11bbbu.lib, dot11bbau.lib, libbba_lutstu.lib, libbba_modu.lib, sora_utility.lib
   To test that everything is set up correctly, run tests: make test-wifi-rx (if this passes, WinDDK + Sora are correctly set up).

Q: How to debug C code?
   There is a VSS solution designed to help debug WPL-compiled C code. 
   It is located in compiler\examples\Wrapper, and it is called Wrapper.sln
   There are two projects in it, CompilerVS2012 and CompilerDDK.
   CompilerVS2012 is for debugging using VS compiler. It does not optimize the code and is easier to debug. 
   CompilerDDK uses the WinDDK environment to compile the code. It can still be run and debugged from the VS environment 
   but it is more difficult to debug because the code is heavily optimized. 
   Before starting, make sure you select the desired project and set it to be the startup project.
   Compile a WPL file into csrc/test.c. 
   Then use the usual VS shortcuts/command to compile/run/debug.
