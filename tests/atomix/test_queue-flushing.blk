{-

This test checks whether pipeline queues are correctly
flushed.

Consider the pipe from c1 to t2: the semantics require that
this pipe is emptied (i.e. (re-)initialized) before each
iteration of the enclosing repeat. Hence, t should never
receive enough data to fire, and the program should not
produce any output.

However, if the pipe is not correctly reset in each iteration,
the program will produce output.
